Question: How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?
 
Answer: to show the result vividly, I make a line chart in covid.py the code is after line 36.
I will also show it below

# answer the question in question.txt that 'How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?'
spain_new_cases = covid_data.loc[covid_data["location"] =="Spain","new_cases"]
spain_total_cases = covid_data.loc[covid_data["location"] =="Spain","total_cases"]
plt.plot(world_new_cases_date, spain_new_cases, color = 'yellowgreen', marker = '^', label = 'Spain new cases')
plt.plot(world_new_cases_date, spain_total_cases, color = 'lightblue', marker = '.', label = 'Spain total cases')
plt.xticks(world_new_cases_date.iloc[0:len(world_new_cases_date):4],rotation = -90)
plt.legend()
plt.title('Spain new cases and total cases')
plt.show()
